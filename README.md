# Japanese Nonogram Solver

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Japanese Nonogram Solver** using **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** with **Backtracking Search** and **Line Solver Algorithms**. The goal is to efficiently solve nonogram puzzles of varying sizes and difficulty levels.

## Features

- **CSP with Backtracking**: Utilizes constraint-based approaches for solving nonograms.
- **Line Solver Algorithm**: Improves efficiency by solving each row/column individually.
- **Heuristics Implementation**: Includes **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** for variable ordering.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual representations of the solved puzzles.
- **MP4 Examples**: Demonstrates the solver in action through videos.

## Files & Structure

- **Implementations of Algorithms/** â†’ Contains core algorithm implementations:
  - `Backtracking Algorithm Implementation.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook for CSP solver.
  - `Line Solver Implementation.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook for line-by-line solving approach.
  - `Line Solver Visualisation.py` â†’ Python script for visualizing solved nonograms.
  - `README.pdf` â†’ Documentation on implementation details.
- **mp4 examples/** â†’ Demonstration videos of the solver:
  - `music.mp4`
  - `question mark.mp4`
  - `robot.mp4`
  - `wumpus.mp4`
- **Final Report.pdf** â†’ Detailed explanation of methods, results, and evaluation.



## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the solver in action.
3. Check the **visualization scripts** and **MP4 examples** for results.

## Conclusion

This project successfully applies CSP and heuristic techniques to solve nonograms efficiently. Future improvements could involve **optimizing heuristics** and **exploring deep learning approaches** for solving more complex puzzles.
